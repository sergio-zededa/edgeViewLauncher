### 2. Favorite/Pin Devices
Star frequently-used devices to pin them at the top of the list.

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` — Focus search bar

## 🎨 UX Polish

### 5. Active Tunnel Indicator
Show a badge/glow on device cards that have active tunnels.

### 6. "Open in Browser" Button
For HTTP ports (80, 443, 8080, 3000), add a button to open `http://localhost:PORT`.

### 7. Tunnel Duration Timer
Display how long each tunnel has been active (e.g., "Connected 5m ago").

## 🛠 Power User Features

### 9. SSH with Custom Port/User
`Shift+Click` on IP opens a mini-prompt for custom username/port instead of `root:22`.

### 10. Bulk Tunnel Management

- Multi-select and close tunnels at once

### 11. Command Palette
Spotlight-style palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) for quick actions: "SSH to X", "Close tunnel Y", etc.
